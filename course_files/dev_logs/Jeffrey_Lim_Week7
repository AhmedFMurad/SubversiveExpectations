Continue working on the XML parsing function, it is not fully functional just yet
Fixed other UI elements that make the app a bit more streamline in use
Started some work on the prize class
Added some to the logging in and out sequences
Prepared for the prototype presentation, figuring out what to present
Tried to load XML data into the app but no success
Instead created example articles that are to be shown in the presentation
